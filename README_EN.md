## Overview

License Manager is a comprehensive software commercialization solution that integrates software licensing management, self-service user portals, and commercial operation capabilities. It supports dual-track operations for both B2B enterprise customers and B2C individual users, providing full-process digital services from registration and purchase to license activation. It employs a hybrid online/offline licensing model combined with hardware binding and RSA digital signatures to ensure security.

✨It enables **any programming language** and **any type of software product** to **quickly integrate licensing capabilities** via standardized **HTTP APIs** and **cross-platform client SDKs**.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cedar-v/license-manager.git
cd license-manager

# Local backend build & run (optional)
cd backend/cmd
go build -o license-manager

# Configuration (choose one)
# 1) Create config.yaml in the working directory (the app looks here first)
#    cp ../configs/config.example.yaml ./config.yaml && edit it
# 2) Edit ../configs/config.yaml (the app will fall back to this path)

./license-manager
```

## Docker Deployment

### Using Pre-built Images (Recommended)

For quick deployment without downloading source code, you can use pre-built GitHub Container Registry images:

For detailed deployment steps, please refer to: [GitHub Images Deployment Guide](docs/github-images-deploy.md)

### Build from Source

We provide ready-to-use Docker Compose files for development and production:

```bash
# Development (first run with --build is recommended)
docker compose up -d --build

# Production
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Verify backend health
curl http://localhost:28888/health
```

Notes
- Backend config is mounted by Compose:
  - Dev: `backend/configs/config.dev.yaml` → `/app/backend/cmd/config.yaml`
  - Prod: `backend/configs/config.prod.yaml` → `/app/backend/cmd/config.yaml`
- Frontend Nginx proxies `/api/` to `backend:28888` inside the Docker network.
- Health checks use `curl`; the backend image includes `curl`.
- For full details (reverse proxy, health checks, mounts, troubleshooting), see `README-Docker.md`.
